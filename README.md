# Introduction
The realisation of this App can help people to track anything they want on their smartphone. Instead of using Excel or paper based lists/tables the user will achieve an easier and smarter advantage with using our App to track or monitor daily life acitivites.

# Data security
After downloading the App on the smartphone all data will be collected only on the device himself. Because of this our App does not need a login or any registration of a user. But the user will have the free choice to send his stored data for an evaluation of his data, for this terms we will require and request some data.

# Concept
## Idea
Our app will replace all Excel or paper based lists/tables which is used for tracking or monitoring life activities. For example the user can use our app instead of an Excel list for recording the daily fitness training exercises. Other life activities are also possible to track.

The big advantage for our App user are:
- the user is free to record different life activities.
- smarter/supported logging of data.
- the user owns and is full of controle of his data.
- the logs are everytime and offline available.
